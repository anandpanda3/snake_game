<h1><b>SNAKE GAME<b></h1>
Objective:
The goal is to build a classic Snake Game where the player controls a snake that moves around a grid, consumes food, and grows longer. The game continues until the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the grid.
Components:

<br>HTML: Sets up the basic structure of the webpage, including a container for the game board.</br>
<br>CSS: Styles the game board and snake for a visually appealing interface.</br>
<br>JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including handling user input, updating the snake's position, generating food, and checking for collisions. The game loop continuously moves the snake and updates the display.</br>

Game Features:
The snake is initially positioned on the grid.
The player can control the snake's direction using arrow keys.
The snake grows longer when it consumes food.
Food appears at random positions on the grid.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the grid boundaries.
After a collision, the game resets, and the player can play again.



How to Play:
Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
Try to eat the food to grow longer.
Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the grid boundaries.
The game ends if a collision occurs, and it can be restarted.

Learning Outcomes:
This project helps developers practice front-end web development skills, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript for interactive and dynamic behavior.
